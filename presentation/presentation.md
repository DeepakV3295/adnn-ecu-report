# Training Neural Networks on Embedded Devices

## Neural Network Applications on Embedded Devices

- (talking point) Used in smart speakers for voice to activate features, "Ok, Google"
- (talking point) Autonomous driving (lot of money going into that)
- (talking point) Skydio autonomous drones

## Embedded Devices

- (talking point) Embedded platforms more varied than these : small computer boxes in trucks, smartphones, voting machines, educational units, robots, so many more
- (talking point) Also present in simpler devices such as IoT lights, smart appliances, etc.

## The Scania C300

- (talking point) anomaly detection applications
- (talking point) hint at federated learning (we shall soon talk about the different paradigms for neural network application lifecycle)

## ARM Boards

- (talking point) ARM: Energy-efficient processors for diverse devices
- (talking point) Application : general purpose, high performance, smartphone | Real-time : automotive airbags, solid state devices | Microcontroller : simpler architecture, low cost, energy efficient

## ARM Boards

- (talking point) ARM board internals
- (talking point) ARM, silicon vendor (NXP), system maker (ACME, Variscite)
- (talking point) internal communication protocols, external interfaces, serial communication buses
