\part{Introduction}

Embedded systems are equipped with a combination of hardware and software components to achieve a specific task. Often, embedded systems are built into a larger device or system and are used to collect, store, process, and analyse data, as well as to control the device\textquotesingle s behaviour. Embedded systems are common in everyday applications due to their simplicity, flexibility and cost-effectiveness

Machine learning on embedded systems is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to provide real-time insight and intelligence to devices. But this technology presents a unique set of challenges due to the limited resources available on these systems. Embedded systems are designed to be power efficient, have limited memory and processing power, and require closely tailored algorithms, making it difficult to use pre-existing machine learning models. Furthermore, embedded systems are often expected to produce real-time results, which further complicates the development process. Despite these challenges, machine learning on embedded systems has potential applications in a variety of areas, such as in the fields of robotics and autonomous vehicles. This technology can be used to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and make better decisions, all while using fewer resources

Estimates put the number of tiny embedded systems devices north of 20 billion (TODO: attach reference) and the potential of running machine learning applications on that compute is enormous. Furthermore the notion of utilising the existing embedded infrastructure for the purpose of performing ML compute as a means for achiever greater utilisation and as opposed to deploying new specialised devices for those applications has an appeal from a sustainability standpoint. However much of the potential of running machine learning appilations on these devices remain unattained due to the difficulties in creating these applications

Among the approaches that would be salient on these platforms, neural network approaches are the most sought after owing to the unprecedented progress made in their practical applications. Tiny Machine Learning is a burgeoning field that looks at how this space of embedded devices can be made more suitable to create and explore the potential machine learning applications that it can support. An important feature of machine learning applications are their iterative improvement process. For neural network applications this happens during the training process which traditionally consumes a lot of compute resource

\subsubsection{Why perform training and inference on ECUs?}

In the world of embedded systems resources such as compute, memory, network bandwith etc. are all limited. The traditional model of sending data from embedded device sensors off-board to compute clusters on the cloud presents several challenges such as bandwith consumption, privacy considerations, and more that makes it attractive to perform both training and inference on-board the embedded device

\paragraph{Federated Learning}{
	One approach to making this training loop take place from within these platforms is Federated Learning which cruicially allows for the data to remain on the device
